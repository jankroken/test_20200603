Java tasks. Do as many as you have time for

open the project in an IDE, and:

1. Change Main so that it can be run from the command line.
   It should be possible to run it with the following arguments:
   - the file name/location for the file with materials and prices
   - the file name/location for the file with the layout to be loaded
   - the file name/location for the output materials and cost report

2. Update the application so that it:
   - loads the layout (from the input layout file)
   - loads the data from the materials file
   - calculates how much of each material is needed and what it will cost
   - writes a cost report in the same format as "sample-expected-output.txt" file

   Make sure the layout is loaded as an actual model, since it will be used to do more than
   just material calculation later

3. Write unit tests to verify that the calculation is correct (use the sample output for this)

4. Extend the application, so that there's a new file containing a set of modifications to the
   layout (so that when you load the model, you can specify that one grass element should
   be replaced with e.g. concrete or a tree. The application should apply all the modifications
   to the layout, and then write the new layout to a separate file, and a matching cost report.
